    account_name: `
      Give a meaningful and unique name so you can identify what information you have in this account.<br>
      For example, it can be MyGmail or, MyPayPal, PrimaryHome-Mortgage etc.When creating an Account, you will notice, there are several fields that let you input more information about this account.
      Don’t worry if you can’t fill all the fields. 
      You can use the notes section to store additional details about an account.`,
    password_hint: `
      DO NOT STORE PASSWORD.<br>
      A Password hint is a cue that enables you to remember your actual password. You can have a decoder on a separate location and share it separately.<br>
      For example, if your password is 1969Ray78759, a combination of : <br>
      - Your Year of birth – 1969 <br>
      - Your first name – Ray <br>
      - Your zip code – 78759 <br>
      You can create a Password Hint for this password, such as: YrBornNameZip<br>
      We don’t recommend saving your actual password, which is why we give you the safer route of setting password hints.`,
    account_group: `
      The Account Group allows you to organize your Accounts and group them by relevance. Think of the account group as a drawer in the file cabinet.<br>
      For example, you can bundle all your home-related accounts under the ‘Home’ Account Group, and all your finance related accounts under the ‘Financial’ Account group.`,
    account_user_id: `User ID to login to this account`,
    website_address: `Website URL / address`,
    note: `Free form information. See the Sample for some ideas.`
